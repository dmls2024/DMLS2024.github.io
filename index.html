                        Decentralized machine learning involves training models on distributed data sources, often
                        without directly sharing the raw data. As the field of machine learning expands and embraces
                        decentralized architectures, ensuring the security of decentralized machine learning becomes
                        crucial. Decentralized machine learning security focuses on developing innovative techniques,
                        algorithms, and frameworks to guarantee the privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of
                        decentralized machine learning systems. It involves developing mechanisms to prevent privacy
                        leakage and unauthorized access to sensitive data during the training process. Ensuring the
                        reliability and trustworthiness of the participants is crucial to prevent adversarial attacks or
                        manipulation of the training process. Additionally, decentralized machine learning security
                        involves addressing resource constraints, optimizing computation and communication overhead, and
                        mitigating the risks associated with system vulnerabilities and attacks.

                    <p class="second">
                        Distributed Machine Learning Security is an important research area that aims to address the
                        security challenges arising from the distributed nature of machine learning systems. By
                        developing robust privacy-preserving techniques, protecting the integrity of models, and
                        securing the communication infrastructure, researchers are working towards enabling the
                        widespread adoption of distributed machine learning in various sensitive domains while ensuring
                        data privacy and model security.

                        The workshop will feature 1-2 keynote speeches given by world-leading researchers in the field.
                        The workshop accepts only original and unpublished papers. Submitted papers must not
                        substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
                        to a journal or a conference with proceedings. The work must be clearly presented in English in
                        Springer LNCS Format. The total length of the final papers is at most 20 pages (for regular
                        papers) and 12 pages (for short papers), including tables, figures, references and appendices.
                        Papers will be selected based on their originality, significance, timeliness, relevance, and
                        clarity of presentation assessed by at least three reviewers.
